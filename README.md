## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles

### What I learned

This project was a great exercise for working with React forms, state management, background images, drag-and-drop file uploads, and custom form validations.  
I also practiced accessibility by ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### Useful resources

- [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) - For state management across components.
- [MDN Web Docs - Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - For understanding form validation best practices.
